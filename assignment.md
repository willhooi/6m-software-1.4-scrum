3. As a library user, I want to suggest/propose a book/resource title for the library to procure so that it will be available locally.
4. As a library user, I want to pay fines that I may incurred digitally so that I do not need to be present physically or use cash. 
5. As a librarian, I want to promote new book/resource titles so that more library users will know and borrow them.
6. As a librarian, I want to view how many books were borrowed, filtered by time, duration, types, etc so that I can understand borrowing patterns.

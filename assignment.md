Question 2:
Write ten (10) user stories for a book-borrowing website for a library. Write it in the format: `As a ____, I want to ____, so that _____`.

```
1. As a library user, I want to search for book titles, authors, subjects so that I can locate them physically in the library.
2. As a library user, I want to view my previous books borrowed so that I can view my past records.
3. As a library user, I want to suggest/propose a book/resource title for the library to procure so that it will be available locally.
4. As a library user, I want to pay fines that I may incurred digitally so that I do not need to be present physically or use cash. 
5. As a librarian, I want to promote new book/resource titles so that more library users will know and borrow them.
6. As a librarian, I want to view how many books were borrowed, filtered by time, duration, types, etc so that I can understand borrowing patterns.
7. As a librarian, I want to create data/info for a resource (book, e-book, etc) so that I can retrieve the data/info in the future.
8. As a librarian, I want to update/deleted data/info for a resource (book, e-book, etc) so that the data/info will reflect the actual data/state (e.g. damaged, lost, missing, etc)
9. As a librarian, I want to prevent book/resources to be borrowed so that I can control the access/borrow priviledges of the users.
10. As a library user, I want to check-out a book/resource automatically so that I do not need to do it physically through a physical station/person.
